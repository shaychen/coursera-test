                        Back in October 2012, hundreds gathered for the opening of the Fairview Downs section of the Hamilton Ring Road. The spring sun shone and locals milled about as the stretch of paddocks they had lived near for years was finally replaced by a ribbon of tarmac stretching from Crosby Rd to the new Fifth Ave roundabout. Almost two years of work had gone into the transformation. Drainage and tarmac had been laid, lights had been installed, the Carrs Rd bridge had been built.<br>
                        I was among the curious crowd, because I lived nearby. When my family and I shifted into the area 20 or so years earlier, we had been told the strip of land grazed by cows was designated for an arterial route. At one stage, that route was intended to be a SH1 motorway.<br>
